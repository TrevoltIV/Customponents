# Welcome to Customponents React Library.

## A full list of properties (props) can be found below, this is how Customponents determines the specific details of your component.

## Note: this library is still in development, some components may not work as expected.
### To install Customponents, currently we do not have an NPM install option, so you will need to copy the directory into your own project.
